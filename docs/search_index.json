Practical motivations for this work exist at the levels of both planning and design, growing from a concern over the state of housing in urban areas. The current housing crisis presents a clear and present need for more housing units in job-proximate areas, and for housing units that are a better match with changing family structures and contemporary household needs. While large-scale real estate development interests have ready access to high-quality market and demographic data, such interests tend to focus on the provision of large-scale multifamily developments on larger parcels of land, which provide a more efficient pathway to profit. As a result, millions of vacant infill lots in highly accessible urban areas that hold potential to provide a needed layer of 2-4 family workforce housing languish because their utilization requires a high degree of sensitivity to the local context in order to provide relevant and viable housing development. In order to match the provision of more units with the provision of more relevant, sustainable, and contextually sensitive development, particularly in low-rise neighborhood fabric, better and more accessible data is required. The ambition of this research, which we consider a work in progress, is to bridge planning level concerns around the existing conditions and future location of housing with site level concerns over the design of future housing and unit types in relationship to the immediate context in terms of both physical character and demographic need. The research also aims to visualize this site-level data in an accessible format with the intent of future action. This aspect of the work aims for practical relevance and applied action. In addition to the diagrams, charts, and images provided in this report, we are working to present the analysis described below in an accessible web-based format that allows key stakeholders to personalize and self-weight a place-based index of parcel level data to meet their own needs in relationship to understanding and incrementally changing urban fabric on a site-by-site basis. The analysis is designed to serve a very specific band of public and private development-related stakeholders by exploring and daylighting an otherwise latent or invisible view onto urban fabric through the lens of value systems that are related to the mission or agenda of key stakeholders within the housing crisis. Stakeholders include local community advocates, civic leaders and policy makers, real estate developers, and designers who aim to better respond to the particularities of a place through site-level response to context. Each stakeholder type has a different value system, requiring a different view of the same data. For example, municipal governance needs a better understanding of the nature and impact of urban change in order to better calibrate zoning, housing policy, and related programming and respond to demographic factors and the character and/or type of existing housing stock. Such stakeholders will aim to protect affordability in historically marginalized communities and encourage equitable development with respect to access to desirable services and destinations (libraries, grocery stores, parks, etc.). Small-scale real estate developers, who do not have the analytic and legal resources of larger-scale developers, who are often members of the local community, and who provide the best opportunity for small-scale infill development at the missing middle scale, need a different weighting of the same data in order to seek housing development opportunities in viable areas. These stakeholders seek development opportunities that balance development feasibility in terms of construction cost and land value with market relevance in terms of unit type, job-accessibility, and location desirability for a given population. Residents and community stakeholders often lack the information and resources to advocate for local change with more than anecdote at public meetings, providing yet another set of values that require the visualization of the same data from a different perspective. For these stakeholders, data about the existing character of their places in terms of demographic and housing unit diversity, including a view onto the existing levels of community access to local resources in comparison to other places, is needed to make a case for future resources and housing types that will benefit the needs of their community. To varying degrees, each stakeholder group currently lacks the tools and information to adequately understand local conditions on their own terms and in a way that is relevant to their particular roles in the provision, regulation, and advocacy of desperately needed housing. This information gap, which we aim to approach through this research, is a barrier to more and more relevant housing. In summary, we aim to utilize site level quantitative analysis to both build upon existing identification and classification efforts, and to provide a practical tool for a range of critical stakeholders within the housing crisis to understand, describe, and advocate for change in urban quality through the lens of their own value systems. 1.1 Report organization The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 discusses related work that we and others have done on the topic of evaluating urban quality and the challenges of highly-disaggregated spatial data. In Chapter 3, we describe a set of workshops we conducted with a diverse set of experts on urban development to identify values associated with urban quality. We go on to propose a method for evaluating urban quality at the parcel level using readily available data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in Chapter 4, and summarize the results of that analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we discuss the alignment of the values suggested in our workshops with the outcomes of our quantitative analysis. Chapter 7 concludes the report with our key takeaways and potential directions for future work. "],["related-work.html", "Chapter 2 Related work 2.1 Neighborhood classification 2.2 Quantification of sprawl 2.3 Conceptualizing urban quality at the site level 2.4 Barriers to site-level urban quality evaluation", " Chapter 2 Related work 2.1 Neighborhood classification There is a large body of literature that seeks to apply quantitative methods to describe or classify urban environments. In 2011, Urban Geography released a special issue devoted to neighborhood classification approaches, including a review of neighborhood classification work that had been done to date (Reibel 2011); a study identifying five distinct neighborhood types in Cleveland and demonstrating how locations transition among types (Mikelbank 2011); a method for identifying ethnic neighborhoods (Logan et al. 2011); and an analysis of New Urban developments that classifies them by how well they meet the ambitions of the New Urbanism movement (Trudeau and Malloy 2011). A common approach to classifying neigborhoods has been to employ factor analysis (principal component analysis) to reduce a large number of variables into a smaller set of factors (or principal components), followed by cluster analysis to group neighborhoods sharing similar characteristics (Voulgaris et al. 2016; Chow 1998; Li and Chuang 2009; Shay and Khattak 2007; Song and Knaap 2007; Song and Quercia 2008; Vicino, Hanlon, and Short 2011). Although the purpose of neighborhood classification studies is to develop a set of categorical neighborhood types, the initial factor analysis step yields a set of indices that can be used as continuous variables describing various dimensions of neighborhood characteristics. 2.2 Quantification of sprawl In general, neighborhood classification studies have differentiated between neighborhoods with a more urban character and those with a more suburban character. Indeed this is often the explicit purpose of such analyses. A related body of work has specifically sought to quanitify sprawl. Hamidi et al. (2015) offers a helpful review of the early work on this topic, noting that early studies emphasized density as a measure of sprawl and that some used satellite imagery to incorporate parameters like fragmentation and fractal dimension. Ewing, Pendall, and Chen (2002) have developed a widely-cited measure of sprawl using principal component analysis to develop indices for four separate dimensions of sprawl (density, land-use diversity, centering, and street accessibility) and averaging them (with equal weights) to generate a single overall sprawl index. Hamidi et al. (2015) later repeated this method with updated data and have published a dataset of county-level and tract-level values for the resulting sprawl index. 2.3 Conceptualizing urban quality at the site level Urban quality may be comparatively measured at the city, neighborhood, and site scales but each of these scales yield different decision-making capacities, and for different stakeholders. Regional planning decisions and high-level policy initiatives operate at the scale of the city; zoning and planning operates at the level of the neighborhood; real estate development and incremental changes to the design and use of urban fabric and form occur at the site level. Because decisions that shape urban quality are often made at the site level, and because neighborhoods can often host a wide diversity of conditions from one edge to another, a parcel-level metric for differentiating among adjacent sites and urban blocks within the same neighborhood would be useful. 2.4 Barriers to site-level urban quality evaluation Because widely available and reliable data for urban classification across many urban places often exists at the levels of the census tract and above, methods for conceptualizing urban quality at the site level are challenging. Moving from the neighborhood level to the site level requires a jump from demographic, econometric, and geospatial data to the scale of human perception. This jump requires design as well as planning expertise. The lack of systematically available data at the site level is due to a variety of factors including privacy and the diverse types of data, including image-based formats, required to address local identity and human perception. Additionally, some variables have no meaning at the site level. While creating buffers around a site might address this to some degree, it requires the existence of complimentary site-level data as well. Methods for understanding site-level experience and conditions have begun to emerge over the past decade, and reliable data is increasingly available through both open public sources and private or open mapping platforms. Groups such as the Trust for Public Land have utilized site level analysis to create applications such as the ParkScore index and related the ParkServe mapping application to broaden understanding of hyper-local conditions and equitable access to open space. Hidalgo et al. [2016] have utilized Google Street view and computer vision applications to approach questions of urban perception at the site level in their PlacePulse project. While the work is not informed by sophisticated urban planning and design expertise, it provides a promising technical method for accessing and utilizing emerging web-based image data alongside computer vision through the use of an application programming interface (API). References "],["expert-perspectives.html", "Chapter 3 Expert Perspectives", " Chapter 3 Expert Perspectives We designed a series of in-person and digital workshops with the goal of understanding what elements or dimensions of urban quality are essential to sustainable (socially, economically, and environmentally) site-level development, and what values should drive an index to measure an ideal location for new housing from the perspective of expert stakeholders. The workshops utilized a simple set of verbal prompts, physical props, and group discussion to explore the value systems of the experts with the intent to understand alignment (or misalignment) between factors drawn from expert values around place-based quality and the factors generated through quantitative analysis. Expert stakeholders invited to the workshop included municipal planners, private sector urban designers and planners, academic planners and designers, and real estate developers. Due to COVID-19 related complications and a variety of other scheduling factors, we were not able to engage real estate developers in this round of workshop sessions. We hope to include their input in future sessions as we refine the work. Figure 3.1: Photograph from May 2022 workshop We prompted participants with the following questions to initiate the workshop conversation: * The best location to build new housing is. . . * The most suitable location to build new housing is. . . * The most feasible location to build new housing is. . . * We should building more housing on site that are. . . Next, we asked the group to share their responses, discuss, and refine the outcomes down to five variables using a system of voting. Once the group converged upon a set of values and characteristics, they developed a set of 3-5 quantitative metrics that could be utilized to measure each value. This step helped us broaden our consideration regarding data set selection. The final step focused on sorting the variables into categories that could be compared to the factor-based outcomes of the quantitative analysis. Top categories cited by participants across all workshops included connectivity (access to jobs and resources, transportation availability and frequency, pedestrian network density, etc.) and parcel viability (scale of parcel, near-by land use designations that are compatible or not, property value and year-over-year sales price, ownership costs, local median rent). The issue of climate risk (based upon resource use in construction or re-use, length of commute, and access to transit) was cited in two out of three workshops. The experts discussed concern over equity in relationship to change commonly referred to as gentrification in all of the workshops, each with a different allocation of related metrics across the categories of parcel connectivity (e.g., access to jobs via transit) and viability (e.g., in an effort to support workforce housing, development would need to be viable for a local median income rather than the area median income). Figure 3.2: Examples from card deck with key questions for workshop Using a deck of cards designed by the research team, workshop participants placed variables relevant to housing location and type on a spectrum and within categories based upon importance and relevance. Through this method, we were able to gain an understanding of the experts perspective on essential values-driven factors or categories of metrics and related data that should drive a sustainable method of locating new housing. We ran this qualitative process of analysis in parallel to our quantitative analysis. Separate researchers conducted these two modes of analysis such that each was blind to the work of the other. Once both streams of analysis concluded we were able to relate and compare the quantitative (data-driven) indices to the qualitative (values-driven) categories (see chapter 6). Figure 3.3: Participants in remote and in-person workshops arranged these digital (right) or physical (left) cards into categories and created new cards with new metrics as needed.

In this chapter, we propose one such approach, using readily-available parcel-level data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 4.1 Data We obtained data on property addresses, land uses, assessed values (for both land and buildings), and sale prices from Allegheny County Office of Property Assessments (2022), which includes information on 582,116 properties in Allegheny County. We also obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for each property from a geocoder file provided by Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2021). Over 99.5 percent of properties included in the assessment dataset are included in the geocoder file. Properties without geocoded locations are excluded from our analysis. Potential development sites were identified as those classified as residential (residential properties with one to four housing units) or commercial (which includes mixed-use developments and residential properties with more than four housing units), and with a land use description in one of 59 possible categories1. The most common of these are listed Table 4.1.2.

Some properties in the assessor dataset are condominums where multiple properties share a single parcel of land. We aggregated these to the site level by identifying all properties with an assessed building value greater than zero, a land value of zero, and a land use description that did not indicate the land was vacant. If multiple such properties share an address, we classified all properties at that address as a condominium and aggregated them to the parcel level. This led to a final sample of 506,405 sites. 4.1.1 Tax assessment data Three variables (total assessed fair market value, assessed fair market value of the building, and lot area) were taken directly from the county tax assessment data for use in our analysis. We also included the most recent listed sales price, adjusted for inflation. To aggregate properties identified as condominiums to the site level, we summed the total values for lot area, assessed land value, assessed building value, and inflation-adjusted sale price. We log-transformed these four variables prior to including them in our analysis. Their distributions are shown in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Distribution of variables from tax assessor database 4.1.2 Accessibilty data Accessibilty was calculated from each of the 518,032 sites in our sample to each of several location types described below. 4.1.2.1 Destination parcels We used land use codes from the county assessor parcel data to identify destination parcels that residents might value access to. The most common land use codes of identified destination parcels are listed in Table 4.2.

The LEHD dataset provides the total number of jobs in each census block in the United States, based on employment tax records. The location of each job was defined as the centroid of the block in which it was located. We downloaded job location data for Pennsylvania and filtered it to include locations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties). In addition to calculating the accessibility to jobs of all categories, we also calculated accessibility to several subsets of jobs. We disaggregated jobs by earnings, reasoning that the usefulness of a job might vary depending on how well it matches a workers skills or wage expectations. High-paying job locations are a subset of job locations where the worker earns more than $3333 per month. Low-paying job locations are those where the worker earns $1250 per month or less. We also disaggregated jobs based on employment industry, based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reasoning that the presence of jobs particular industries might represent a shopping or recreation destination. Retail job locations are a subset of job locations in NAICS sector 44-45 (retail trade); Entertainment job locations are those in NAICS sector 71 (arts, entertainment, and recreation); and Hospitality job locations are those in NAICS sector 72 (accommodation and food services). Finally, we identified three location types that correspond with common non-work trips: schools, grocery stores, and parks. Grocery store locations were identified as vendors participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC vendor locations and school locations were obtained from the Allegheny County GIS portal (Allegheny County Office of Information Technology 2018, 2020). Park locations were taken from the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 2015). Park locations were downloaded for Pennsylvania and filtered to Allegheny county. We used the r5r package in the R programming language (Pereira et al. 2021) to calculate accessibility each destination type described above, for each of four transportation modes (walking, cycling, driving, and transit). The r5r package calculates accessibility as the weighted total number of destinations reachable by a given mode, where destinations are weighted according to a decay function, such that destinations that can be reached within less time are assigned greater weight. We used a logistic decay function, as illustrated in 4.2. For motorized modes, the decay function had a mean (inflection) of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. For non-motorized modes, the decay function had a mean of 20 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. Figure 4.2: Decay functions for accessibility calculations Calculating accessibility metrics for a combination of four transportation modes and ten destination types yields 40 different accessibility variables. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distributions of each of these variables. Figure 4.3: Distributions of accessibility variables 4.1.3 Disamenity proximity We categorized several land uses in the county assessor data as disamenities. The land use codes we used to identify disamenities are listed in 4.34.

The distribution of this index is shown in 4.4. Figure 4.4: Distribution of average distance to nearest ten disamenity sites 4.1.4 Density To represent the residential density around each site, we used the sf (Pebesma 2018), nngeo (Dorman 2022) and tidycensus (Walker and Herman 2022) R packages to determine the smallest circular buffer around each site containing a population of at least two thousand people, based on the 2020 census. In denser places, a buffer with a smaller radius would encompass two thousand residents. In more sparsely-populated places, a buffer containing two thousand residents would be larger. The distribution of radii for two-thousand-person site buffers is shown in 4.5. Figure 4.5: Histogram of radii of buffer containing 2000 residents 4.1.5 Population diversity The two-thousand-resident buffers described above were also used as a basis to estimate the racial diversity of residents in the immediate vicinity. For each buffer, we calculated the percentage of residents that who identified in the 2020 census as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. The distributions of these variables are shown in 4.6. Figure 4.6: Distributions of population diversity variables 4.1.6 Land use diversity We also calculated the total number of different land uses within each two-thousand-resident buffer and used this as a measure of land-use diversity. 4.7. Figure 4.7: Histogram of land use diversity 4.2 Index development The methods described above yielded a set of fifty parcel-level variables, forty of which are accessibility metrics, for each of 506,405 parcels. We used the EFAtools R package (Steiner and Grieder 2020) to develop a set of parcel level indices from these variables using factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion for the dataset is 0.9, suggesting a marvellous case for factor analysis (Kaiser 1974). We determined the appropriate number of factors based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion and the Hull method.The Hull method suggests an optimal number of factors that balances model fit and number of parameters, with a goal or keeping only major factors. Potential solutions with various number of factors are plotted on a graph of goodness-of-fit versus degrees of freedom, where the optimal solution will be on the boundary of a convex hull (Lorenzo-Seva, Timmerman, and Kiers 2011). The Kaiser-Guttmat criterion is a recommendation to retain as many factors as there are sample eigenvalues greater than one (Guttman 1954). We computed factor loadings using an oblimin rotation. We applied these loadings to calculate a set of index scores (one for each factor) for each potential development site. 4.3 Index validation The indices we developed through factor analysis might represent dimensions of urban quality. If they are valid quality metrics, one might expect them to be predictive of an activity associated with desirable locations for development. We hypothesize that more desirable locations for development might be those where plans have been made for new development activity and that building permits for new construction or demolition are indicative of such plans. We estimated a logistic regression model using the indices developed through factor analysis as independent variables and predicting the likelihood that a site in the city of Pittsburgh was issued a a building permit for either construction or demolition over a one-year period (June 2021 - May 2022). Building permit data were obtained from Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2022). Out of 269,151 potential residential development sites in Pittsburgh, 139 (one twentieth of one percent) had building permits issued for new construction or demolition of a residential structure during the study period. 4.4 Combined index If the indices we developed represent distinct dimensions of urban quality, the relative importance of each dimension (and its associated index) might vary depending on the values of the individual or institution seeking to assess urban quality. However, the results of the regression analysis might offer insight into the typical or average values of active housing developers and property owners in Pittsburgh. We used the regression coefficients estimated to predict the likelihood of a recent building permit (as described above) to generate weights for each index, scaled such that the highest coefficient represented a weight of one hundred percent. We used these weights to calculate a combined index value for each site.

Figure 5.1 illustrates the results of the Hull method with a plot of goodness-of-fit versus degrees of freedom for potential solutions with numbers of factors ranging from zero to fourteen. Figure 5.2 illustrates that there are five eigenvalues greater than one, suggesting a five-factor solution according to the Kaiser-Guttman Criterion. Figure 5.1: Results of Kaiser-Guttman criterion for determining the number of factors Figure 5.2: Results of Hull method for determining the number of factors We assigned names to each factor based on a visual inspection of the results. The drivable factor had the highest loadings for variables representing access by car to most destination types. The walkable factor has high loadings for variables representing access by walking and transit. The diverse index is characterized by diversity of people (high percentages of black residents and low percentages of white residents), diversity of land use (a greater number of distinct land uses in the immediate vicinity and a shorter average distance to disamenities), and lower assessed property values. The dense factor is characterized by lower values for the radius of the smallest buffer containing two thousand residents (i.e. higher population densities) and higher access to retail and grocery locations by non-motorized modes. The amenities factor is characterized by non-motorized and transit access to retail and grocery locations. Figure 5.3 illustrates the loadings of each individual variable onto each of the five factors. Figure 5.3: Factor loadings 5.2 Indices from factors Figures 5.4 through 5.8 show the spatial variation in the drivability, walkability, density, diversity, and amenity-richness indices, respectively. Figure 5.4: Spatial variation in drivability index As illistrated in Figure 5.4, there is an area in the center of the region (downtown Pittsburgh) with particularly low drivablity (likely due to traffic congestion), surrounded by a ring around the center with particularly high drivability. Figure 5.5: Spatial variation in walkability index Figure 5.5 shows the opposite pattern for walkabilty, with particularly high walkability in the center of the region and a ring of surrounding the center with particularly low walkability. Figure 5.6 shows pockets of low density in the center of the region, possibly because the density index is driven by residental density and these are commercial centers with relatively few residents. With the exception of those pockets, the density is generally highest in the center of the county and lowest closer to the boundaries. Figure 5.6: Spatial variation in density index Figure 5.7 suggests that the greatest diversity (with an index representing both sociodemographic and land-use diversity) is found in areas adjacent to the center of the region. Figure 5.7: Spatial variation in diversity index Figure 5.8: Spatial variation in amenity-richness index Finally, Figure 5.8 suggests an amenity-poor area at the center of the region surrounded by and amenity-rich ring, with remainder of the county having an amenity richness closer to the county average. Figure 5.9 illustrates the distribution of each factor and the relationships among them. In general, there appears to be a trade-off between drivability and walkability and between drivability and diversity. There also appears to be a negative association between density and diversity. This may be because land-use diversity was measured as the number of unique land uses within the smallest buffer containing at least 2,000 residents. In very dense places, this buffer might be too small to include a large number of unique land uses. Figure 5.9: Spatial variation in amenity-richness index 5.3 Factor validation through regression Table 5.1 shows the results of three alternative regression models. The first of these is a null model, which assumes that likelihood of the modeled outcome (in this case, a building permit for construction or demolition) is constant across all sites. The second model (labeled as the full model) predicts that likelihood based on the variation in the three indices generated by the factor analysis. As shown, four of the five factors are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of a building permit at a 99.9 percent confidence level, and this model fits the data better than the null model based on three measures of model fit: The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the pseudo R^2. Based on the results of the full model, the amenity-richness index is not a significant predictor of the likelihood of a building permit, so a reduced model was estimated without that variable. In this reduced model, the remaining model coefficients were unchanged and the model fit was essentially unchanged.

Figure 5.10 shows how the predicted probability of development changes as each index varies from -5 to 5 (i.e. from five standard deviations below the average to five standard deviations above the average). Figure 5.10: Effect of drivability, walkabilty, diversity, and density on development probability 5.4 Combined index Recent development activity has been consistent with a hypothesis that four of the five indices developed from the factor analysis results represent dimensions of urban quality that matter to developers and property owners. We can combine these four indices into a combined index by calculated a weighted average, where weights are derived from the coefficients of the regression model described above. The distribution of the resulting index is shown in Figure 5.11. Figure 5.12 shows the spatial distribution of this index across Pittsburgh, with the locations of the building permits used to estimate the model shown for reference. Figure 5.11: Distribution of combined index, weighted according to coefficients from regression predicting the likelihood of a building permit for construction or demolition Figure 5.12: Locations of building permits for new construction and demolition and their estimated likelihood Figure 5.13 shows the spatial distribution of the combined index across the entire study area. It is noteworthy that there is less variation within the inset area than there is for any of the four indices it comprises. This is because low scores on one index generally compensate for high scores on another. Figure 5.13: Spatial variation in combined index, weighted according to coefficients from regression predicting the likelihood of a building permit for construction or demolition "],["relating-indices-to-values.html", "Chapter 6 Relating Indices to Values", " Chapter 6 Relating Indices to Values There is some alignment between the qualitative (values-driven) categories that emerged from the workshop and the indices produced by the quantitative analysis. This alignment is strongest surrounding variables related to connectivity. High connectivity to jobs and local resources relates (see factor loading) within the quantitative analysis; workshop participants identified and grouped the same variables as relevant to urban qualities related to both socio-economic viability (job access) and environmental sustainability (reduced carbon expenditure on commutes). Sites that are highly connected to walkable resources and jobs (via bike or transit) are viewed by the experts as good places to locate future housing; they are presented in the factor analysis under the categories of walkable and dense. We would also like to address the quantitative results in relationship to the values of the experts around the issue of low-income and workforce housing as it intersects with urban change or gentrification. The quantitative analysis currently enables an understanding of where development is likely to occur based upon trends such as building permits. Both the quantitative outcomes and our experiential knowledge of the study area show that these areas tend to be highly walkable, diverse, and connected. This outcome points to the intersection of desirability and feasibility but also raises the issue of gentrification, which is a concern of the experts. It is worth noting that our lived experience with study area indicates that the walkable index is strongly related to high property values and demographic variables such as race and income. We would also like to note our observations on the quantitative analysis from the perspective of lived experience, using a neighborhood called the Hill District area as an example. The Hill District, an area that is highly proximate to downtown Pittsburgh (via bike) and that also suffers from historic disinvestment and marginalization, is shown within the quantitative analysis as high in density and drivability, moderate in diversity, and low in walkability. Our experience in the study area suggests that it is a highly suitable area for future housing in that it is central, close to many jobs, and has many vacant parcels of land. However, the lack of walkable resources  such as grocery stores and libraries  makes it less attractive as a profitable investment. This potential divergence between long-term suitability and short-term suitability (or immediate market viability) is notable. While the Hill District is high in qualities related to density it would likely require long-term and substantial public investment and attention to make it feasible for new housing development in the short-term. In the future, we would like to explore the relationship between density and walkability as indicators of long-term and short-term potential as they relate to housing development and private vs. public stakeholders. In general, more consideration is needed into the composition and meaning of each of the indices in relationship to the disciplinary and civic values that emerged through the workshops. The density index is of particularly high interest because of its ability to identify potentially suitable sites that do not always conform to obvious existing market opportunities. We not that serious consideration needs to be given to the relationship between quantitative results and disciplinary values (qualitative workshop data) as it translates into a practical tool for understanding existing urban quality and citing future housing or focusing housing-related policy. For example, future research may engage the buffering method and income data to focus on the site-based prioritization of housing for an existing local median income to enable stakeholders to understand site-level quality in relationship to a recommendation for future housing driven by the value of a social sustainability and equity. This is an area of friction between the quantitative analysis and workshop outcomes that can be explored in the future through the translation of quantitative analysis into practical application by stakeholders via values-driven data visualization and interaction design. "],["conclusions-and-future-directions.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusions and Future Directions", " Chapter 7 Conclusions and Future Directions This work balances quantitative and qualitative views on our urban world at the site scale, where incremental urban change occurs. We believe its cross-disciplinary nature, along with focus on a values-driven application for quantitative analysis, holds great potential for future practice in the development of our built world, which must balance disciplinary intuition and values with computational capacity and increasingly large data sets through carefully designed processes for human-machine collaboration. The method of segregating quantitative and qualitative analysis was highly productive. The factor-based analysis yielded intriguing results that require further consideration and mediation through the inclusion of expert values-based input. While some variables tested held no relevance at the site level in relationship to factor analysis, we believe there are other variables that should be included in the future that would optimize analysis in relationship to on-the-ground experience of urban quality and sustainability. Overall, we find that site-level analysis is complimentary to city- and neighborhood-scale analysis in that it provides a clear picture of the natural boundaries and fault lines of a place rather than those drawn by governmental authority. This scale also allows for an understanding of edge conditions and block-scale nuance, which strongly shape the experience of a place. In more detail, we find that a combination of buffering and discreet site-level data is a promising pathway toward an understanding of the qualities of an area at the site level, and that such methods should pursued in the future with different data types. For example, there is an unexplored opportunity to integrate climate-related factors in a more robust way. Right now, the measure of environmental sustainability is contingent upon carbon production in relationship to transportation. In the future, parcel level metrics including urban heat island effect (via Landsat data) and building type and age (via parcel data) may hold potential for exploration. In alignment with the ambition pursuing parcel-level analysis that closer approximates human perception of a place, we have also begun to explore the possibility of systematically engaging street level views of each parcel utilizing Google Street Views and computer vision. The addition of such data, which is a close approximation of human experience on the ground, may enable this research to better bridge the intents of planning and design: to better locate or prioritize the location of future housing within an urban area, and to recommend relevant unit and building types for a given site and its local context. While initial ambitions for this parcel-level analysis and visualization relate specifically to small-scale (2-4 unit) infill housing, we are aware that there are other relevant applications and stakeholders. Future work may focus on transportation planning or use-related zoning optimization. Applications that focus more on recommendations for unit or housing type would also be useful. For our research team, future work should prioritize 1) refinement of the data sets and quantitative analysis based upon the inclusion of an approximation of human perspective at the site level, 2) deeper exploration of variables related to building-level sustainability, 3) collection of additional workshop related data from experts in real estate development and community advocacy, and 4) pursuit of a web application for data visualization that utilizes the values-driven perspectives of disciplinary experts to drive the design of an interface layer between human stakeholders and quantitative analysis at the site level. Figure 7.1: Screen captures of the web application demonstrate early tests that translate quantitative analysis into an interactive application to visualize urban quality at the site level. The images show how the indices can be weighted by the user to reflect user values and needs. Figure 7.2: Early interaction design tests with a two different versions of user controls that weight the indices to enable the user to personalize their visualization of the research results and their understanding of the site-level qualities of the study area. This function allows users to self-weight the data according to their individual needs. Right now we have directly translated the results of quantitative analysis into the application. In the future, the label of the indices will change for clarity and to align with disciplinary values. Such a tool would enable stakeholders to access and calibrate indices based upon essential expert values alongside the individual stakeholder value systems and information needs. We have already begun this work and have created a web application that enables users to calibrate the visualization of the data presented above through the lens of the quantitative indices. Progress on this aspect of the work can be explored at this link: https://leahwelch.github.io/projects/pittsburgh-map-sm/. The optimization of this substantial data set for web visualization is a work in progress and we are currently working to employ a better strategy for both virtual machine use and legible interactivity. Additional consideration around the meaning of the factors vis a vis disciplinary values (the creation of a just city, for instance) is needed in order for such a tool to optimize relevance in practice with the aim of better rather than (simply) more development.
