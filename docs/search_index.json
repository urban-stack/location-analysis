You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

We also obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for each property from a geocoder file provided by Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2021). Over 99.5 percent of properties included in the assessment dataset are included in the geocoder file. Properties without geocoded locations are excluded from our analysis, leaving a total of 579,473 properties. Potential development sites were identified as those classified as residential (indicating residential properties with one to four housing units) or commercial (which includes mixed-use developments and residential properties with more than four housing units) and with a land use description in one of 59 possible categories. The most common of these are listed Table 4.11. One site (3008 Phillip Dr in Clairton) is missing a land use description in the assessment data. We checked this address on Zillow to determine that this is a single-family home and classified it as such in our data.

Potential building sites were further filtered to exclude those with missing data on the most recent sale (6,574 sites, or about one percent of all sites).2 for a total of 526,237 potential sites. The focus of this analysis is on potential development sites rather than on properties. Some properties in the assessor dataset are condominums where multiple properties share a single parcel of land. We aggregated these to the site level by identifying all properties with an assessed building value greater than zero, a land value of zero, and a land use description that did not indicate the land was vacant. If multiple such properties share an address, we classified all properties at that address as a condominium and aggregated them to the parcel level. This led to a final sample of 518,316 sites. 4.1.1 Aspatial data Three variables (total assessed fair market value, assessed fair market value of the building, and lot area) were taken directly from the assessment data for use in our analysis. We calculated two additional variables from the assessment data: the inflation-adjusted sales price and the average number of years between sales. The average of: The number of years between the most recent sale and the publication data of the assessment data (May 1, 2022); The number of years between the most recent sale and the second-most recent sale3; and The number of years between the second-most recent sale and the third-most recent sale, if a third-most recent sale is listed. To aggregate properties identified as condominiums to the site level, we summed the total values for lot area, assessed land value, assessed building value, and inflation-adjusted sale price and averaged values for the average number of years between sales. write_csv(sites, here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;sites.csv&quot;)) 4.1.2 Accessibilty data Accessibilty was calculated from each of the 518,316 sites in our sample to each of several location types described below. We used land use codes from the county assessor parcel data to identify destination parcels that residents might value access to. The most common land use codes of identified destination parcels are listed in 4.2.

The LEHD dataset provides the total number of jobs in each census block in the United States, based on employment tax records. The location of each job was defined as the centroid of the block in which it was located. We downloaded job location data for Pennsylvania and filtered it to include locations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties). In addition to calculating the accessibility to jobs of all categories, we also calculated accessibility to several subsets of jobs. We disaggregated jobs by earnings, reasoning that the usefulness of a job might vary depending on how well it matches a workers skills or wage expectations. High-paying job locations are a subset of job locations where the worker earns more than $3333 per month. Low-paying job locations are those where the worker earns $1250 per month or less. We also disaggregated jobs based on employment industry, based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reasoning that the presence of jobs particular industries might represent a shopping or recreation destination. Retail job locations are a subset of job locations in NAICS sector 44-45 (retail trade); Entertainment job locations are those in NAICS sector 71 (arts, entertainment, and recreation); and Hospitality job locations are those in NAICS sector 72 (accommodation and food services). Finally we identified three location types that correspond with common non-work trips: schools, grocery stores, and parks. Grocery store locations were identified as vendors participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC vendor locations and school locations were obtained from the and location data came from the Allegheny County GIS portal (Allegheny County Office of Information Technology 2018, 2020). Park locations were taken from the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 2015). Data were downloaded for Pennsylvania and filtered to Allegheny county. We used the r5r package in the R programming language (Pereira et al. 2021) to calculate accessibility was calculated for each destination type described above for each of four transportation modes (walking, cycling, driving, and transit). The r5r package calculates accessibility as the weighted total number of destinations reachable by a given mode, where destinations are weighted according to a decay function, such that destinations that can be reached within less time are assigned greater weight. We used a logistic decay function, as illustrated in ??. For motorized modes, the decay function had a mean (inflection) of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. For non-motorized modes, the decay function had a mean of 20 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. Calculating accessibility metrics for a combination of four transportation modes and ten destination types yeilds 40 different accessibility variables. 4.1.3 Density data For each site, we calculated the density of four different (dis)amenites in the immediates vicinity (defined as the area within a one-kilometer radius): homes, pedestrian paths (including sidewalks and all routes open to pedestrians), roads that are not open to pedestrians (such as freeways), and land uses identified in county assessor data as one of several types that we categorized as disamenities. The land use codes we used to identify disamenities are listed in Housing density (use number of homes within 1/2 mile circle) Ped network density (use mileage of ped network within 1/2 mile circle) Number of disamenities in a 1/2 mile circle Mileage of non-ped roads in 1/2 mile circle References "],["footnotes-and-citations.html", "Chapter 5 Footnotes and citations 5.1 Footnotes 5.2 Citations", " Chapter 5 Footnotes and citations 5.1 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[].
