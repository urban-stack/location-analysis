Chapter 2 discusses related work that we and others have done on the topic of evaluating urban quality and the challenges of highly-disaggregated spatial data. In Chapter 3, we describe a set of workshops we conducted with a diverse set of experts on urban development to identify values associated with urban quality. We go on to propose a method for evaluating urban quality at the parcel level using readily available data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in Chapter 4, and summarize the results of that analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we discuss the alignment of the values suggested in our workshops with the outcomes of our quantitative analysis. Chapter 7 concludes the report with our key takeaways and potential directions for future work.

In this chapter, we define one such approach, using readily-available parcel-level data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 3.1 Data We obtained data on property addresses, land uses, assessed values (for both land and buildings), and the dates and prices of as many as the three most-recent sales from Allegheny County Office of Property Assessments (2022), which includes information on 582,116 properties in Allegheny County. We also obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for each property from a geocoder file provided by Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2021). Over 99.5 percent of properties included in the assessment dataset are included in the geocoder file. Properties without geocoded locations are excluded from our analysis. Potential development sites were identified as those classified as residential (indicating residential properties with one to four housing units) or commercial (which includes mixed-use developments and residential properties with more than four housing units), and with a land use description in one of 59 possible categories1. The most common of these are listed Table 3.1.2.

The focus of this analysis is on potential development sites rather than on properties. Some properties in the assessor dataset are condominums where multiple properties share a single parcel of land. We aggregated these to the site level by identifying all properties with an assessed building value greater than zero, a land value of zero, and a land use description that did not indicate the land was vacant. If multiple such properties share an address, we classified all properties at that address as a condominium and aggregated them to the parcel level. This led to a final sample of 518,032 sites. 3.1.1 Tax assessment data Three variables (total assessed fair market value, assessed fair market value of the building, and lot area) were taken directly from the county tax assessment data for use in our analysis. We also included the most recent listed sales price, adjusted for inflation. To aggregate properties identified as condominiums to the site level, we summed the total values for lot area, assessed land value, assessed building value, and inflation-adjusted sale price. We log-transformed these four variables prior to including them in our analysis. Their distributions are shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Distribution of variables from tax assessor database 3.1.2 Accessibilty data Accessibilty was calculated from each of the 518,032 sites in our sample to each of several location types described below. 3.1.2.1 Destination parcels We used land use codes from the county assessor parcel data to identify destination parcels that residents might value access to. The most common land use codes of identified destination parcels are listed in Table 3.2.

The LEHD dataset provides the total number of jobs in each census block in the United States, based on employment tax records. The location of each job was defined as the centroid of the block in which it was located. We downloaded job location data for Pennsylvania and filtered it to include locations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties). In addition to calculating the accessibility to jobs of all categories, we also calculated accessibility to several subsets of jobs. We disaggregated jobs by earnings, reasoning that the usefulness of a job might vary depending on how well it matches a workers skills or wage expectations. High-paying job locations are a subset of job locations where the worker earns more than $3333 per month. Low-paying job locations are those where the worker earns $1250 per month or less. We also disaggregated jobs based on employment industry, based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reasoning that the presence of jobs particular industries might represent a shopping or recreation destination. Retail job locations are a subset of job locations in NAICS sector 44-45 (retail trade); Entertainment job locations are those in NAICS sector 71 (arts, entertainment, and recreation); and Hospitality job locations are those in NAICS sector 72 (accommodation and food services). Finally, we identified three location types that correspond with common non-work trips: schools, grocery stores, and parks. Grocery store locations were identified as vendors participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC vendor locations and school locations were obtained from the Allegheny County GIS portal (Allegheny County Office of Information Technology 2018, 2020). Park locations were taken from the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 2015). Park locations were downloaded for Pennsylvania and filtered to Allegheny county. We used the r5r package in the R programming language (Pereira et al. 2021) to calculate accessibility each destination type described above, for each of four transportation modes (walking, cycling, driving, and transit). The r5r package calculates accessibility as the weighted total number of destinations reachable by a given mode, where destinations are weighted according to a decay function, such that destinations that can be reached within less time are assigned greater weight. We used a logistic decay function, as illustrated in 3.2. For motorized modes, the decay function had a mean (inflection) of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. For non-motorized modes, the decay function had a mean of 20 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. Figure 3.2: Decay functions for accessibility calculations Calculating accessibility metrics for a combination of four transportation modes and ten destination types yields 40 different accessibility variables. 3.2 illustrates the distributions of each of these variables. Figure 3.3: Distributions of accessibility variables 3.1.3 Disamenity proximity We categorized several land uses in the county assessor data as disamenities. The land use codes we used to identify disamenities are listed in ??4. We included a disamenity proximity index in our analysis that we calculated as the logarithm of the average distance from each site to the ten closest disamenity sites. The distribution of this index is shown in 3.4. Figure 3.4: Distribution of average distance to nearest ten disamenity sites 3.1.4 Density To represent the residential density around each site, we used the sf (Pebesma 2018), nngeo (Dorman 2022) and tidycensus (Walker and Herman 2022) R packages to determine the smallest circular buffer around each site containing a population of at least two thousand people, based on the 2020 census. In denser places, a buffer with a smaller radius would encompass two thousand residents. In more sparsely-populated places, a buffer containing two thousand residents would be larger. The distribution of radii for two-thousand-person site buffers is shown in 3.5. Figure 3.5: Histogram of radii of buffer containing 2000 residents 3.1.5 Population diversity The two-thousand-resident buffers described above were also used as a basis to estimate the racial diversity of residents in the immediate vicinity. For each buffer, we calculated the percentage of residents that who identified in the 2020 census as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. The distributions of these variables are shown in 3.6. Figure 3.6: Histograms of population diversity variables 3.1.6 Land use diversity We also calculated the total number of different land uses within each two-thousand-resident buffer and used this as a measure of land-use diversity. 3.7. Figure 3.7: Histogram of land use diversity 3.2 Index development The methods described above yielded a set of fifty parcel-level variables, forty of which are accessibility metrics, for each of 506,405 parcels. We used the EFAtools R package (Steiner and Grieder 2020) to develop a set of parcel level indices from these variables using factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion for the dataset is 0.9, suggesting a marvellous case for factor analysis (Kaiser 1974). We determined the appropriate number of factors based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (Guttman 1954) and the Hull method (Lorenzo-Seva, Timmerman, and Kiers 2011) and computed factor loadings using an oblimin rotation. 3.3 Index validation To assess whether the resulting indices were predictive of recent development, we estimated a logistic regression model predicting the likelihood that a site in the city of Pittsburgh was issued a a building permit for either construction or demolition over a one-year period (June 2021 - May 2022). Building permit data were obtained from Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2022).

We assigned names to each factor based on a visual inspection of the results. The drivable factor had the highest loadings for variables representing access by car to most destination types. The walkable factor has high loadings for variables representing access by walking and transit. The diverse index is characterized by diversity of people (high percentages of black residents and low percentages of white residents), diversity of land use (a greater number of distinct land uses in the immediate vicinity and a shorter average distance to disamenities), and lower assessed property values. The dense factor is characterized by lower values for the radius of the smallest buffer containing two thousand residents (i.e. higher population densities) and higher access to retail and grocery locations by non-motorized modes. The amenities factor is characterized by non-motorized and transit access to retail and grocery locations.
