You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Motivation for the project.

We also obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for each property from a geocoder file provided by Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (2021). Over 99.5 percent of properties included in the assessment dataset are included in the geocoder file. Properties without geocoded locations are excluded from our analysis. Potential development sites were identified as those classified as residential (indicating residential properties with one to four housing units) or commercial (which includes mixed-use developments and residential properties with more than four housing units) and with a land use description in one of 59 possible categories1. The most common of these are listed Table 4.12.

The focus of this analysis is on potential development sites rather than on properties. Some properties in the assessor dataset are condominums where multiple properties share a single parcel of land. We aggregated these to the site level by identifying all properties with an assessed building value greater than zero, a land value of zero, and a land use description that did not indicate the land was vacant. If multiple such properties share an address, we classified all properties at that address as a condominium and aggregated them to the parcel level. This led to a final sample of 518,032 sites. 4.1.1 Tax assessment data Three variables (total assessed fair market value, assessed fair market value of the building, and lot area) were taken directly from the county tax assessment data for use in our analysis. We also included the most recent listed sales price, adjusted for inflation. To aggregate properties identified as condominiums to the site level, we summed the total values for lot area, assessed land value, assessed building value, and inflation-adjusted sale price. Summary statistics for the tax assessor variables are listed in Table 4.2.

The LEHD dataset provides the total number of jobs in each census block in the United States, based on employment tax records. The location of each job was defined as the centroid of the block in which it was located. We downloaded job location data for Pennsylvania and filtered it to include locations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties). In addition to calculating the accessibility to jobs of all categories, we also calculated accessibility to several subsets of jobs. We disaggregated jobs by earnings, reasoning that the usefulness of a job might vary depending on how well it matches a workers skills or wage expectations. High-paying job locations are a subset of job locations where the worker earns more than $3333 per month. Low-paying job locations are those where the worker earns $1250 per month or less. We also disaggregated jobs based on employment industry, based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reasoning that the presence of jobs particular industries might represent a shopping or recreation destination. Retail job locations are a subset of job locations in NAICS sector 44-45 (retail trade); Entertainment job locations are those in NAICS sector 71 (arts, entertainment, and recreation); and Hospitality job locations are those in NAICS sector 72 (accommodation and food services). Finally, we identified three location types that correspond with common non-work trips: schools, grocery stores, and parks. Grocery store locations were identified as vendors participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC vendor locations and school locations were obtained from the Allegheny County GIS portal (Allegheny County Office of Information Technology 2018, 2020). Park locations were taken from the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 2015). Park locations were downloaded for Pennsylvania and filtered to Allegheny county. We used the r5r package in the R programming language (Pereira et al. 2021) to calculate accessibility each destination type described above, for each of four transportation modes (walking, cycling, driving, and transit). The r5r package calculates accessibility as the weighted total number of destinations reachable by a given mode, where destinations are weighted according to a decay function, such that destinations that can be reached within less time are assigned greater weight. We used a logistic decay function, as illustrated in 4.1. For motorized modes, the decay function had a mean (inflection) of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. For non-motorized modes, the decay function had a mean of 20 minutes and a standard deviation of 5 minutes. Figure 4.1: Decay functions for accessibility calculations Calculating accessibility metrics for a combination of four transportation modes and ten destination types yields 40 different accessibility variables. 4.1 illustrates the distributions of each of these variables. Figure 4.2: Distributions of accessibility variables 4.1.3 Disamenity proximity We categorized several land uses in the county assessor data as disamenities. The land use codes we used to identify disamenities are listed in ??4. We included a disamenity proximity index in our analysis that we calculated as the logarithm of the average distance from each site to the ten closest disamenity sites. The distribution of this index is shown in 4.3. Figure 4.3: Distribution of average distance to nearest ten disamenity sites 4.1.4 Density To represent the residential density around each site, we used the sf (Pebesma 2018), nngeo (Dorman 2022) and tidycensus (Walker and Herman 2022) R packages to determine the smallest circular buffer around each site containing a population of at least two thousand people, based on the 2020 census. In denser places, a buffer with a smaller radius would encompass two thousand residents. In more sparsely-populated places, a buffer containing two thousand residents would be larger. The distribution of radii for two-thousand-person site buffers is shown in 4.4. Figure 4.4: Histogram of radii of buffer containing 2000 residents 4.1.5 Population diversity The two-thousand-resident buffers described above were also used as a basis to estimate the racial diversity of residents in the immediate vicinity. For each buffer, we calculated the percentage of residents that who identified in the 2020 census as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. The distributions of these variables are shown in 4.5. Figure 4.5: Histograms of population diversity variables 4.1.6 Land use diversity We also calculated the total number of different land uses within each two-thousand-resident buffer and used this as a measure of land-use diversity. 4.6.
