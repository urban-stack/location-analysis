\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This work aims to build upon existing research into the identification and classification of urban quality and sustainability in order to focus such efforts at the parcel scale and build a more systematic understanding of urban character at the scale at which incremental urban change and human interaction occurs within neighborhood fabric.

Practical motivations for this work exist at the levels of both planning and design, growing from a concern over the state of housing in urban areas. The current housing crisis presents a clear and present need for more housing units in job-proximate areas, and for housing units that are a better match with changing family structures and contemporary household needs. While large-scale real estate development interests have ready access to high-quality market and demographic data, such interests tend to focus on the provision of large-scale multifamily developments on larger parcels of land, which provide a more efficient pathway to profit. As a result, millions of vacant infill lots in highly accessible urban areas that hold potential to provide a needed layer of 2-4 family workforce housing languish because their utilization requires a high degree of sensitivity to the local context in order to provide relevant and viable housing development.

In order to match the provision of more units with the provision of more relevant, sustainable, and contextually sensitive development, particularly in low-rise neighborhood fabric, better and more accessible data is required. The ambition of this research, which we consider a work in progress, is to bridge planning level concerns around the existing conditions and future location of housing with site level concerns over the design of future housing and unit types in relationship to the immediate context in terms of both physical character and demographic need.

The research also aims to visualize this site-level data in an accessible format with the intent of future action. This aspect of the work aims for practical relevance and applied action. In addition to the diagrams, charts, and images provided in this report, we are working to present the analysis described below in an accessible web-based format that allows key stakeholders to personalize and self-weight a place-based index of parcel level data to meet their own needs in relationship to understanding and incrementally changing urban fabric on a site-by-site basis.

The analysis is designed to serve a very specific band of public and private development-related stakeholders by exploring and daylighting an otherwise latent or invisible view onto urban fabric through the lens of value systems that are related to the mission or agenda of key stakeholders within the housing crisis. Stakeholders include local community advocates, civic leaders and policy makers, real estate developers, and designers who aim to better respond to the particularities of a place through site-level response to context.

Each stakeholder type has a different value system, requiring a different view of the same data. For example, municipal governance needs a better understanding of the nature and impact of urban change in order to better calibrate zoning, housing policy, and related programming and respond to demographic factors and the character and/or type of existing housing stock. Such stakeholders will aim to protect affordability in historically marginalized communities and encourage equitable development with respect to access to desirable services and destinations (libraries, grocery stores, parks, etc.).

Small-scale real estate developers, who do not have the analytic and legal resources of larger-scale developers, who are often members of the local community, and who provide the best opportunity for small-scale infill development at the ``missing middle'' scale, need a different weighting of the same data in order to seek housing development opportunities in viable areas. These stakeholders seek development opportunities that balance development feasibility in terms of construction cost and land value with market relevance in terms of unit type, job-accessibility, and location desirability for a given population.

Residents and community stakeholders often lack the information and resources to advocate for local change with more than anecdote at public meetings, providing yet another set of values that require the visualization of the same data from a different perspective. For these stakeholders, data about the existing character of their places in terms of demographic and housing unit diversity, including a view onto the existing levels of community access to local resources in comparison to other places, is needed to make a case for future resources and housing types that will benefit the needs of their community.

To varying degrees, each stakeholder group currently lacks the tools and information to adequately understand local conditions on their own terms and in a way that is relevant to their particular roles in the provision, regulation, and advocacy of desperately needed housing. This information gap, which we aim to approach through this research, is a barrier to more and more relevant housing.

In summary, we aim to utilize site level quantitative analysis to both build upon existing identification and classification efforts, and to provide a practical tool for a range of critical stakeholders within the housing crisis to understand, describe, and advocate for change in urban quality through the lens of their own value systems.

\section{Report organization}\label{report-organization}}

The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 discusses related
work that we and others have done on the topic of evaluating urban quality
and the challenges of highly-disaggregated spatial data. In Chapter 3, we
describe a set of workshops we conducted with a diverse set of experts on
urban development to identify values associated with urban quality. We go on
to propose a method for evaluating urban quality at the parcel level using
readily available data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in Chapter 4, and
summarize the results of that analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we discuss
the alignment of the values suggested in our workshops with the outcomes
of our quantitative analysis. Chapter 7 concludes the report with our key
takeaways and potential directions for future work.

\hypertarget{neighborhood-classification}{%
\section{Neighborhood classification}\label{neighborhood-classification}}

There is a large body of literature that seeks to apply quantitative methods to
describe or classify urban environments. In 2011, Urban Geography released a
special issue devoted to neighborhood classification approaches, including a
review of neighborhood classification work that had been done to date \citep{reibel2011classification};
a study identifying five distinct neighborhood types in Cleveland and
demonstrating how locations transition among types \citep{mikelbank2011neighborhood};
a method for identifying ethnic neighborhoods \citep{logan2011identifying}; and an
analysis of New Urban developments that classifies them by how well they meet the
ambitions of the New Urbanism movement \citep{trudeau2011suburbs}. A common approach to
classifying neigborhoods has been to employ factor analysis (principal
component analysis) to reduce a large number
of variables into a smaller set of factors (or principal components), followed by
cluster analysis to group neighborhoods sharing similar characteristics \citep{voulgaris_synergistic_2016, chow_differentiating_1998, li_neighborhood_2009, shay_automobiles_2007, song_quantitative_2007, song_how_2008, vicino_typology_2011}.
Although the purpose of neighborhood classification studies is to develop a set
of categorical neighborhood types, the initial factor analysis step yields a set
of indices that can be used as continuous variables describing various dimensions
of neighborhood characteristics.

\hypertarget{quantification-of-sprawl}{%
\section{Quantification of sprawl}\label{quantification-of-sprawl}}

In general, neighborhood classification studies have differentiated between
neighborhoods with a more urban character and those with a more suburban
character. Indeed this is often the explicit purpose of such analyses. A
related body of work has specifically sought to quanitify sprawl. \citet{hamidi2015measuring}
offers a helpful review of the early work on this topic, noting that early studies
emphasized density as a measure of sprawl and that some used satellite imagery
to incorporate parameters like fragmentation and fractal dimension. \citet{ewing_measuring_2002}
have developed a widely-cited measure of sprawl using principal component analysis
to develop indices for four separate dimensions of sprawl (density, land-use diversity,
centering, and street accessibility) and averaging them (with equal weights) to generate
a single overall sprawl index. \citet{hamidi2015measuring} later repeated this method with
updated data and have published a dataset of county-level and tract-level values
for the resulting sprawl index.

\hypertarget{conceptualizing-urban-quality-at-the-site-level}{%
\section{Conceptualizing urban quality at the site level}\label{conceptualizing-urban-quality-at-the-site-level}}

Urban quality may be comparatively measured at the city, neighborhood, and site scales but each of these scales yield different decision-making capacities, and for different stakeholders. Regional planning decisions and high-level policy initiatives operate at the scale of the city; zoning and planning operates at the level of the neighborhood; real estate development and incremental changes to the design and use of urban fabric and form occur at the site level.

Because decisions that shape urban quality are often made at the site level, and because neighborhoods can often host a wide diversity of conditions from one edge to another, a parcel-level metric for differentiating among adjacent sites and urban blocks within the same neighborhood would be useful.

\hypertarget{barriers-to-site-level-urban-quality-evaluation}{%
\section{Barriers to site-level urban quality evaluation}\label{barriers-to-site-level-urban-quality-evaluation}}

Because widely available and reliable data for urban classification across many urban places often exists at the levels of the census tract and above, methods for conceptualizing urban quality at the site level are challenging. Moving from the neighborhood level to the site level requires a jump from demographic, econometric, and geospatial data to the scale of human perception. This jump requires design as well as planning expertise. The lack of systematically available data at the site level is due to a variety of factors including privacy and the diverse types of data, including image-based formats, required to address local identity and human perception. Additionally, some variables have no meaning at the site level. While creating buffers around a site might address this to some degree, it requires the existence of complimentary site-level data as well.

Methods for understanding site-level experience and conditions have begun to emerge over the past decade, and reliable data is increasingly available through both open public sources and private or open mapping platforms. Groups such as the Trust for Public Land have utilized site level analysis to create applications such as the ParkScore index and related the ParkServe mapping application to broaden understanding of hyper-local conditions and equitable access to open space. Hidalgo et al.~{[}2016{]} have utilized Google Street view and computer vision applications to approach questions of urban perception at the site level in their PlacePulse project. While the work is not informed by sophisticated urban planning and design expertise, it provides a promising technical method for accessing and utilizing emerging web-based image data alongside computer vision through the use of an application programming interface (API).

\hypertarget{expert-perspectives}{%
\chapter{Expert Perspectives}\label{expert-perspectives}}

We designed a series of in-person and digital workshops with the
goal of understanding what elements or dimensions of urban quality
are essential to sustainable (socially, economically, and
environmentally) site-level development, and what values should
drive an index to measure an ideal location for new housing from the
perspective of expert stakeholders. The workshops utilized a simple
set of verbal prompts, physical props, and group discussion to
explore the value systems of the experts with the intent to
understand alignment (or misalignment) between factors drawn from
expert values around place-based quality and the factors generated
through quantitative analysis.

Expert stakeholders invited to the workshop included municipal
planners, private sector urban designers and planners, academic
planners and designers, and real estate developers. Due to COVID-19
related complications and a variety of other scheduling factors, we
were not able to engage real estate developers in this round of
workshop sessions. We hope to include their input in future sessions
as we refine the work.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/fig_3a} \caption{Photograph from May 2022 workshop}\label{fig:fig3a}
\end{figure}

We prompted participants with the following questions to initiate
the workshop conversation:
* The best location to build new housing is. . .
* The most suitable location to build new housing is. . .
* The most feasible location to build new housing is. . .
* We should building more housing on site that are. . .

Next, we asked the group to share their responses, discuss, and
refine the outcomes down to five variables using a system of voting.
Once the group converged upon a set of values and characteristics,
they developed a set of 3-5 quantitative metrics that could be
utilized to measure each value. This step helped us broaden our
consideration regarding data set selection. The final step focused
on sorting the variables into categories that could be compared to the factor-based outcomes of the quantitative analysis.

Top categories cited by participants across all workshops included connectivity (access to jobs and resources, transportation availability and frequency, pedestrian network density, etc.) and parcel viability (scale of parcel, near-by land use designations that are compatible or not, property value and year-over-year sales price, ownership costs, local median rent). The issue of climate risk (based upon resource use in construction or re-use, length of commute, and access to transit) was cited in two out of three workshops. The experts discussed concern over equity in relationship to change commonly referred to as gentrification in all of the workshops, each with a different allocation of related metrics across the categories of parcel connectivity (e.g., access to jobs via transit) and viability (e.g., in an effort to support workforce housing, development would need to be viable for a ``local median income'' rather than the area median income).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/fig_3b} \caption{Examples from card deck with key questions for workshop}\label{fig:fig3b}
\end{figure}

Using a deck of cards designed by the research team, workshop participants placed variables relevant to housing location and type on a spectrum and within categories based upon importance and relevance. Through this method, we were able to gain an understanding of the experts' perspective on essential values-driven factors or categories of metrics and related data that should drive a sustainable method of locating new housing.

We ran this qualitative process of analysis in parallel to our quantitative analysis. Separate researchers conducted these two modes of analysis such that each was ``blind'' to the work of the other. Once both streams of analysis concluded we were able to relate and compare the quantitative (data-driven) indices to the qualitative (values-driven) categories (see chapter 6).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/fig_3c} \caption{Participants in remote and in-person workshops arranged these digital (right) or physical (left) cards into categories and created new cards with new metrics as needed.}\label{fig:fig3c}

\chapter{Quantitative Methods}\label{quantitative-methods}}

How might results of quantitative approach to evaluating urban quality at the
parcel level align with the values identified in the workshops described in
Chapter 3? In this chapter, we propose one such approach, using
readily-available parcel-level data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

We obtained data on property addresses, land uses, assessed values (for both
land and buildings), and sale prices
from \citet{allegheny_county_office_of_property_assessments_allegheny_2022}, which
includes information on 582,116 properties in Allegheny County.

We also obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for each property from a
geocoder file provided by \citet{western_pennsylvania_regional_data_center_geocoders_2021}.
Over 99.5 percent of properties included in the assessment dataset are included
in the geocoder file. Properties without geocoded locations are excluded from
our analysis.

Potential development sites were identified as those

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  classified as ``residential'' (residential properties with one to
  four housing units) or ``commercial'' (which includes mixed-use developments
  and residential properties with more than four housing units), and
\item
  with a land use description in one of 59 possible categories\footnote{One site (3008
    Phillip Dr in Clairton) is missing a land use description in the assessment data.
    We checked this address on Zillow to determine that this is a single-family home
    and classified it as such in our data.}. The most common of these are listed Table \ref{tab:list-site-uses}.\footnote{The land use descriptions that were
    classified as potential development sites but are not listed in Table

Potential building sites were further filtered to exclude those with missing data
on the most recent sale (about one percent of all sites).\footnote{Four sites had sales
  prices listed that were unreasonably high. 3039 Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh is
  listed as having sold for \$511,945,000 on August 30, 2021. Zillow lists this
  property as having sold on that date for \$511,945
  (\url{https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3039-W-Liberty-Ave-Pittsburgh-PA-15216/2070262638_zpid/}, accessed 5/4/2022),
  so the value was corrected for what appears to have been a typo. 220 Hyeholde Dr
  in Coraopolis is listed as having sold for \$28,100,000 in 1967. This may also
  be a typo, and it also does not seem to be the most recent sale. Zillow lists
  this home as having sold for \$350,000 in 2004
  (\url{https://www.zillow.com/homes/220-hyeholde-dr,-Coraopolis,-PA_rb/11552817_zpid/},
  accessed 5/4/2022), so the data was corrected to add that as the most recent sale.
  Two other sites were identified as having unreasonably high sales values: 1339
  Arlington Avenue in Pittsburgh is a three-bedroom single-family home that is
  listed as having sold for \$57,010,813 in 1976 and a 0.06-acre vacant lot with
  tax ID 0165G00270000000 is listed as having sold for \$24,920,232 in 1936. The
  sales data for these sites were treated as missing.}

The focus of this analysis is on potential development sites rather than on
properties. Some properties in the assessor dataset are condominums where
multiple properties share a single parcel of land. We aggregated these to the
site level by identifying all properties with an assessed building value
greater than zero, a land value of zero, and a land use description that did
not indicate the land was vacant. If multiple such properties share an address,
we classified all properties at that address as a condominium and aggregated
them to the parcel level. This led to a final sample of 506,405 sites.

\hypertarget{tax-assessment-data}{%
\subsection{Tax assessment data}\label{tax-assessment-data}}

Three variables (total assessed fair market value, assessed fair market
value of the building, and lot area) were taken directly from the county
tax assessment data for use in our analysis. We also included the most
recent listed sales price, adjusted for inflation.

To aggregate properties identified as condominiums to the site level, we summed
the total values for lot area, assessed land value, assessed building value, and
inflation-adjusted sale price. We log-transformed these four variables prior to
including them in our analysis. Their distributions are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:assessor-hist}.

\hypertarget{job-locations}{%
\subsubsection{Job locations}\label{job-locations}}

We identified \emph{job locations} based on data from a Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) dataset published by the United States Census
Bureau \citep{united_states_census_bureau_lehd_2021}. The LEHD dataset provides the
total number of jobs in each census block in the United States, based on
employment tax records. The location of each job was defined as the centroid of
the block in which it was located. We downloaded job location data for
Pennsylvania and filtered it to include locations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan
area (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington, and
Westmoreland counties).

In addition to calculating the accessibility to jobs of all categories, we also
calculated accessibility to several subsets of jobs. We disaggregated jobs by
earnings, reasoning that the usefulness of a job might vary depending on how
well it matches a workers skills or wage expectations. \emph{High-paying job locations}
are a subset of job locations where the worker earns more than \$3333 per month.
\emph{Low-paying job locations} are those where the worker earns \$1250 per month or less.

We also disaggregated jobs based on employment industry, based on the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reasoning that the presence of
jobs particular industries might represent a shopping or recreation destination.
\emph{Retail job locations} are a subset of job locations in NAICS sector 44-45
(retail trade); \emph{Entertainment job locations} are those in NAICS sector 71
(arts, entertainment, and recreation); and \emph{Hospitality job locations} are
those in NAICS sector 72 (accommodation and food services).

Finally, we identified three location types that correspond with common non-work
trips: schools, grocery stores, and parks. \emph{Grocery store locations} were
identified as vendors participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC vendor locations and \emph{school locations}
were obtained from the Allegheny County GIS portal
\citep{allegheny_county_office_of_information_technology_allegheny_2018, allegheny_county_office_of_information_technology_allegheny_2020}.
\emph{Park locations} were taken from the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse
\citep{pennsylvania_department_of_conservation_and_natural_resources_pennsylvania_2015}.
Park locations were downloaded for Pennsylvania and filtered to Allegheny county.

We used the r5r package in the R programming language \citep{pereira_r5r_2021} to
calculate accessibility each destination type described above,
for each of four transportation modes (walking, cycling, driving, and transit).
The r5r package calculates accessibility as the weighted total number of
destinations reachable by a given mode, where destinations are weighted
according to a decay function, such that destinations that can be reached within
less time are assigned greater weight. We used a logistic decay function, as
illustrated in \ref{fig:show-decay-func}. For motorized modes, the decay
function had a mean (inflection) of 40 minutes and a standard deviation of 10
minutes. For non-motorized modes, the decay function had a mean of 20 minutes
and a standard deviation of 5 minutes.

Calculating accessibility metrics for a combination of four transportation
modes and ten destination types yields 40 different accessibility variables. Figure \ref{fig:show-decay-func}
illustrates the distributions of each of these variables.

We categorized several land uses in the county assessor data as

We included a disamenity proximity index in our analysis that we calculated
as the logarithm of the average distance from each site to the ten closest
disamenity sites. The distribution of this index is shown in \ref{fig:bad-prox}.

\hypertarget{density}{%
\subsection{Density}\label{density}}

To represent the residential density around each site, we used the sf \citep{sf}, nngeo
\citep{nngeo} and tidycensus \citep{tidycensus} R packages to determine the smallest circular
buffer around each site containing a population of at least two thousand people,
based on the 2020 census. In denser places, a buffer with a smaller radius would
encompass two thousand residents. In more sparsely-populated places, a buffer
containing two thousand residents would be larger. The distribution of radii for
two-thousand-person site buffers is shown in \ref{fig:radii}.

The two-thousand-resident buffers described above were also used as a basis to
estimate the racial diversity of residents in the immediate vicinity. For each
buffer, we calculated the percentage of residents that who identified in the 2020
census as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. The distributions
of these variables are shown in \ref{fig:divers-hist}.

\hypertarget{index-development}{%
\section{Index development}\label{index-development}}

The methods described above yielded a set of fifty parcel-level variables,
forty of which are accessibility metrics, for each of 506,405 parcels. We used
the EFAtools R package \citep{EFAtools} to develop a set of parcel level indices from
these variables using factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion for the
dataset is 0.9, suggesting a ``marvellous'' case for factor analysis \citep{kaiser1974index}.

We determined the appropriate number of factors based on the Kaiser-Guttman criterion and the Hull method.The Hull method suggests an
optimal number of factors that balances model fit and number of parameters, with a goal
or keeping only major factors. Potential solutions with various number of factors are
plotted on a graph of goodness-of-fit versus degrees of freedom, where the optimal
solution will be on the boundary of a convex hull \citep{lorenzo2011hull}. The Kaiser-Guttmat criterion is a
recommendation to retain as many factors as there are
sample eigenvalues greater than one \citep{guttman1954some}.

We computed factor loadings
using an oblimin rotation. We applied these loadings to calculate a set of index
scores (one for each factor) for each potential development site.

\hypertarget{index-validation}{%
\section{Index validation}\label{index-validation}}

The indices we developed through factor analysis might represent dimensions of
urban quality. If they are valid quality metrics, one might expect them to
be predictive of an activity associated with desirable locations for development.

We hypothesize that more desirable locations for development might be those where
plans have been made for new development activity and that building permits for
new construction or demolition are indicative of such plans.

We estimated a logistic regression model using the indices developed through
factor analysis as independent variables and predicting the likelihood that
a site in the city of Pittsburgh was issued a a building permit for either
construction or demolition over a one-year period (June 2021 - May 2022). Building
permit data were obtained from \citet{western_pennsylvania_regional_data_center_permits_2022}.
Out of 269,151 potential residential development sites in Pittsburgh, 139 (one
twentieth of one percent) had building permits issued for new construction or
demolition of a residential structure during the study period.

\hypertarget{combined-index}{%
\section{Combined index}\label{combined-index}}

If the indices we developed represent distinct dimensions of urban quality,
the relative importance of each dimension (and its associated index) might vary
depending on the values of the individual or institution seeking to assess urban
quality. However, the results of the regression analysis might offer insight into
the typical or average values of active housing developers and property owners in
Pittsburgh.

We used the regression coefficients estimated to predict the likelihood
of a recent building permit (as described above) to generate weights for
each index, scaled such that the highest coefficient represented a weight
of one hundred percent. We used these weights to calculate a combined index
value for each site.

\hypertarget{quantitative-results}{%
\chapter{Quantitative Results}\label{quantitative-results}}

This chapter summarizes the results of the factor analysis, index development,
index validation, and the development of a combined index to describe site-level
variation in urban quality.

\hypertarget{factor-analysis}{%
\section{Factor analysis}\label{factor-analysis}}

Both the Hull method and the Kaiser-Guttman
criterion suggested a five-factor solution would
be appropriate for out data set. Figure \ref{fig:hull-figure} illustrates
the results of the Hull method with a plot of
goodness-of-fit versus degrees of freedom for potential solutions with numbers
of factors ranging from zero to fourteen. Figure \ref{fig:kgc-figure} illustrates that there are
five eigenvalues greater than one, suggesting a
five-factor solution according to the Kaiser-Guttman Criterion.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/hull-n-factors} \caption{Results of Kaiser-Guttman criterion for determining the number of factors}\label{fig:hull-figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/KGC-n-factors} \caption{Results of Hull method for determining the number of factors}\label{fig:kgc-figure}
\end{figure}

We assigned names to each factor based on a visual
inspection of the results. The \emph{drivable} factor had the highest loadings
for variables representing access by car to most destination types. The
\emph{walkable} factor has high loadings for variables representing access
by walking and transit. The \emph{diverse} index is characterized by diversity of
people (high percentages of black residents and low percentages of white
residents), diversity of land use (a greater number of distinct land
uses in the immediate vicinity and a shorter average distance to disamenities),
and lower assessed property values. The \emph{dense} factor is characterized by lower
values for the radius of the smallest buffer containing two thousand residents
(i.e.~higher population densities) and higher access to retail and grocery
locations by non-motorized modes. The \emph{amenities} factor is characterized
by non-motorized and transit access to retail and grocery locations. Figure
\ref{fig:loading-fig} illustrates the loadings of each individual variable
onto each of the five factors.

\hypertarget{indices-from-factors}{%
\section{Indices from factors}\label{indices-from-factors}}

Figures \ref{fig:drive-map} through \ref{fig:amenities-map} show the spatial
variation in the drivability, walkability, density, diversity, and
amenity-richness indices, respectively.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/drivable} \caption{Spatial variation in drivability index}\label{fig:drive-map}
\end{figure}

As illistrated in Figure
\ref{fig:drive-map}, there is an area in the center of the
region (downtown Pittsburgh) with particularly low
drivablity (likely due to traffic congestion), surrounded
by a ring around the center with particularly high
drivability.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/walkable} \caption{Spatial variation in walkability index}\label{fig:walk-map}
\end{figure}

Figure
\ref{fig:walk-map} shows the opposite pattern for walkabilty,
with particularly high walkability in the center of the
region and a ring of surrounding the center with particularly low walkability.

Figure \ref{fig:dense-map} shows pockets of low density in the
center of the region, possibly because the density index is
driven by residental density and these are commercial centers
with relatively few residents. With the exception of those
pockets, the density is generally highest in the center of the
county and lowest closer to the boundaries.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/dense} \caption{Spatial variation in density index}\label{fig:dense-map}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:diverse-map} suggests that the greatest diversity
(with an index representing both sociodemographic and land-use
diversity) is found in areas adjacent to the center of the region.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/diverse} \caption{Spatial variation in diversity index}\label{fig:diverse-map}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/amenities} \caption{Spatial variation in amenity-richness index}\label{fig:amenities-map}
\end{figure}

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:amenities-map} suggests an amenity-poor
area at the center of the region surrounded by and amenity-rich ring,
with remainder of the county having an amenity richness closer to the
county average.

Figure \ref{fig:factor-cor} illustrates the distribution of each factor and the
relationships among them. In general, there appears to be a
trade-off between drivability and walkability and between drivability and diversity.
There also appears to be a negative association
between density and diversity. This may be because land-use diversity was measured
as the number of unique land uses
within the smallest buffer containing at least 2,000 residents. In very dense places,
this buffer might be too small to include a large number of unique land uses.

\hypertarget{factor-validation-through-regression}{%
\section{Factor validation through regression}\label{factor-validation-through-regression}}

Table \ref{tab:regress} shows the results of three alternative regression models. The first of these is a
null model, which assumes that likelihood of the modeled outcome (in this case, a building permit for construction
or demolition) is constant across all sites. The second model
(labeled as the ``full model'') predicts that likelihood based
on the variation in the three indices generated by the
factor analysis. As shown, four of the five factors are
statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of
a building permit at a 99.9 percent confidence level, and this model fits the data better than the null model
based on three measures of model fit: The Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the pseudo R\^{}2. Based on the results of the full model, the amenity-richness index is not a significant predictor
of the likelihood of a building permit, so a reduced model
was estimated without that variable. In this reduced model,
the remaining model coefficients were unchanged and the
model fit was essentially unchanged.

Figure \ref{fig:effect-plot} shows how the predicted probability
of development changes as each index varies from -5 to 5
(i.e.~from five standard deviations below the average to
five standard deviations above the average).

\section{Combined index}\label{combined-index-1}}

Recent development activity has been consistent with a hypothesis that four of the
five indices developed from the factor analysis results represent dimensions of
urban quality that matter to developers and property owners. We can combine these
four indices into a combined index by calculated a weighted average, where weights
are derived from the coefficients of the regression model described above. The
distribution of the resulting index is shown in Figure \ref{fig:combined-hist}.
Figure \ref{fig:combined-pitt} shows the spatial distribution of this index
across Pittsburgh, with the locations of the building permits used to estimate
the model shown for reference.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:combined-map} shows the spatial distribution of the combined index
across the entire study area. It is noteworthy that there is less variation within
the inset area than there is for any of the four indices it comprises. This is because
low scores on one index generally compensate for high scores on another.

\chapter{Relating Indices to Values}\label{relating-indices-to-values}}

There is some alignment between the qualitative (values-driven) categories that emerged from the workshop and the indices produced by the quantitative analysis. This alignment is strongest surrounding variables related to connectivity. High connectivity to jobs and local resources relates (see factor loading) within the quantitative analysis; workshop participants identified and grouped the same variables as relevant to urban qualities related to both socio-economic viability (job access) and environmental sustainability (reduced carbon expenditure on commutes). Sites that are highly connected to walkable resources and jobs (via bike or transit) are viewed by the experts as good places to locate future housing; they are presented in the factor analysis under the categories of ``walkable'' and ``dense.''

We would also like to address the quantitative results in relationship to the values of the experts around the issue of low-income and workforce housing as it intersects with urban change or gentrification. The quantitative analysis currently enables an understanding of where development is likely to occur based upon trends such as building permits. Both the quantitative outcomes and our experiential knowledge of the study area show that these areas tend to be highly walkable, diverse, and connected. This outcome points to the intersection of desirability and feasibility but also raises the issue of gentrification, which is a concern of the experts. It is worth noting that our lived experience with study area indicates that the ``walkable'' index is strongly related to high property values and demographic variables such as race and income.

We would also like to note our observations on the quantitative analysis from the perspective of lived experience, using a neighborhood called the Hill District area as an example. The Hill District, an area that is highly proximate to downtown Pittsburgh (via bike) and that also suffers from historic disinvestment and marginalization, is shown within the quantitative analysis as high in ``density'' and ``drivability,'' moderate in ``diversity,'' and low in ``walkability.'' Our experience in the study area suggests that it is a highly suitable area for future housing in that it is central, close to many jobs, and has many vacant parcels of land. However, the lack of walkable resources -- such as grocery stores and libraries -- makes it less attractive as a profitable investment.

This potential divergence between long-term suitability and short-term suitability (or immediate market viability) is notable. While the Hill District is high in qualities related to ``density'' it would likely require long-term and substantial public investment and attention to make it feasible for new housing development in the short-term. In the future, we would like to explore the relationship between ``density'' and ``walkability'' as indicators of long-term and short-term potential as they relate to housing development and private vs.~public stakeholders. In general, more consideration is needed into the composition and meaning of each of the indices in relationship to the disciplinary and civic values that emerged through the workshops. The ``density'' index is of particularly high interest because of its ability to identify potentially suitable sites that do not always conform to obvious existing market opportunities.

We not that serious consideration needs to be given to the relationship between quantitative results and disciplinary values (qualitative workshop data) as it translates into a practical tool for understanding existing urban quality and citing future housing or focusing housing-related policy. For example, future research may engage the buffering method and income data to focus on the site-based prioritization of housing for an existing local median income to enable stakeholders to understand site-level quality in relationship to a recommendation for future housing driven by the value of a social sustainability and equity. This is an area of friction between the quantitative analysis and workshop outcomes that can be explored in the future through the translation of quantitative analysis into practical application by stakeholders via values-driven data visualization and interaction design.

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}\label{conclusions-and-future-directions}}

This work balances quantitative and qualitative views on our urban world at the site scale, where incremental urban change occurs. We believe its cross-disciplinary nature, along with focus on a values-driven application for quantitative analysis, holds great potential for future practice in the development of our built world, which must balance disciplinary intuition and values with computational capacity and increasingly large data sets through carefully designed processes for human-machine collaboration.

The method of segregating quantitative and qualitative analysis was highly productive. The factor-based analysis yielded intriguing results that require further consideration and mediation through the inclusion of expert values-based input. While some variables tested held no relevance at the site level in relationship to factor analysis, we believe there are other variables that should be included in the future that would optimize analysis in relationship to on-the-ground experience of urban quality and sustainability. Overall, we find that site-level analysis is complimentary to city- and neighborhood-scale analysis in that it provides a clear picture of the ``natural'' boundaries and fault lines of a place rather than those drawn by governmental authority. This scale also allows for an understanding of edge conditions and block-scale nuance, which strongly shape the experience of a place.

In more detail, we find that a combination of buffering and discreet site-level data is a promising pathway toward an understanding of the qualities of an area at the site level, and that such methods should pursued in the future with different data types. For example, there is an unexplored opportunity to integrate climate-related factors in a more robust way. Right now, the measure of environmental sustainability is contingent upon carbon production in relationship to transportation. In the future, parcel level metrics including urban heat island effect (via Landsat data) and building type and age (via parcel data) may hold potential for exploration. In alignment with the ambition pursuing parcel-level analysis that closer approximates human perception of a place, we have also begun to explore the possibility of systematically engaging street level views of each parcel utilizing Google Street Views and computer vision. The addition of such data, which is a close approximation of human experience on the ground, may enable this research to better bridge the intents of planning and design: to better locate or prioritize the location of future housing within an urban area, and to recommend relevant unit and building types for a given site and its local context.

While initial ambitions for this parcel-level analysis and visualization relate specifically to small-scale (2-4 unit) infill housing, we are aware that there are other relevant applications and stakeholders. Future work may focus on transportation planning or use-related zoning optimization. Applications that focus more on recommendations for unit or housing type would also be useful.
For our research team, future work should prioritize 1) refinement of the data sets and quantitative analysis based upon the inclusion of an approximation of human perspective at the site level, 2) deeper exploration of variables related to building-level sustainability, 3) collection of additional workshop related data from experts in real estate development and community advocacy, and 4) pursuit of a web application for data visualization that utilizes the values-driven perspectives of disciplinary experts to drive the design of an interface layer between human stakeholders and quantitative analysis at the site level.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/fig_7a} \caption{Screen captures of the web application demonstrate early tests that translate quantitative analysis into an interactive application to visualize urban quality at the site level. The images show how the indices can be weighted by the user to reflect user values and needs.}\label{fig:fig7a}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{04_figures/fig_7b} \caption{Early interaction design tests with a two different versions of user controls that weight the indices to enable the user to personalize their visualization of the research results and their understanding of the site-level qualities of the study area. This function allows users to self-weight the data according to their individual needs. Right now we have directly translated the results of quantitative analysis into the application. In the future, the label of the indices will change for clarity and to align with disciplinary values.}\label{fig:fig7b}
\end{figure}

Such a tool would enable stakeholders to access and calibrate indices based upon essential expert values alongside the individual stakeholder value systems and information needs. We have already begun this work and have created a web application that enables users to calibrate the visualization of the data presented above through the lens of the quantitative indices. Progress on this aspect of the work can be explored at this link: \url{https://leahwelch.github.io/projects/pittsburgh-map-sm/}. The optimization of this substantial data set for web visualization is a work in progress and we are currently working to employ a better strategy for both virtual machine use and legible interactivity. Additional consideration around the meaning of the factors vis a vis disciplinary values (the creation of a just city, for instance) is needed in order for such a tool to optimize relevance in practice with the aim of better rather than (simply) more development.
