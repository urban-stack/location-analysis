## Neighborhood classification

There is a large body of literature that seeks to apply quantitative methods to 
describe or classify urban environments. In 2011, Urban Geography released a 
special issue devoted to neighborhood classification approaches, including a 
review of neighborhood classification work that had been done to date [@reibel2011classification];
a study identifying five distinct neighborhood types in Cleveland and 
demonstrating how locations transition among types [@mikelbank2011neighborhood];
a method for identifying ethnic neighborhoods [@logan2011identifying]; and an
analysis of New Urban developments that classifies them by how well they meet the 
ambitions of the New Urbanism movement [@trudeau2011suburbs]. A common approach to 
classifying neigborhoods has been to employ factor analysis (principal
component analysis) to reduce a large number
of variables into a smaller set of factors (or principal components), followed by
cluster analysis to group neighborhoods sharing similar characteristics [@voulgaris_synergistic_2016; @chow_differentiating_1998; @li_neighborhood_2009; @shay_automobiles_2007; @song_quantitative_2007; @song_how_2008; @vicino_typology_2011]. 
Although the purpose of neighborhood classification studies is to develop a set 
of categorical neighborhood types, the initial factor analysis step yields a set 
of indices that can be used as continuous variables describing various dimensions 
of neighborhood characteristics.

## Quantification of sprawl

In general, neighborhood classification studies have differentiated between 
neighborhoods with a more urban character and those with a more suburban 
character. Indeed this is often the explicit purpose of such analyses. A 
related body of work has specifically sought to quanitify sprawl. @hamidi2015measuring
offers a helpful review of the early work on this topic, noting that early studies
emphasized density as a measure of sprawl and that some used satellite imagery 
to incorporate parameters like fragmentation and fractal dimension. @ewing_measuring_2002
have developed a widely-cited measure of sprawl using principal component analysis
to develop indices for four separate dimensions of sprawl (density, land-use diversity, 
centering, and street accessibility) and averaging them (with equal weights) to generate
a single overall sprawl index. @hamidi2015measuring later repeated this method with 
updated data and have published a dataset of county-level and tract-level values
for the resulting sprawl index. 

## Conceptualizing urban quality at the site level

At what scale should urban quality be measured? City? Neighborhood? Site?

The case for sites: Decisions that shape urban quality are often made at the
site level, and a parcel-level metric for differentiating among adjactent sites 
within the same neighborhood would be useful.

## Barriers to site-level urban quality evaluation

Some variables have no meaning at the site level (buffers around a site might
address this - but it requires the existance of other site-level data).

Some variables aren't available at the site level (data privacy is a big part of this.)
