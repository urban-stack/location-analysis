# Introduction

Elizabeth will write 2,000 words or so about the motivations and vision for
this project.

## Report organization

The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 discusses related 
work that we and others have done on the topic of evaluating urban quality 
and the challenges of highly-disaggregated spatial data. In Chapter 3, we 
describe a set of workshops we conducted with a diverse set of experts on 
urban development to identify values associated with urban quality. We go on
to propose a method for evaluating urban quality at the parcel level using 
readily available data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in Chapter 4, and 
summarize the results of that analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we discuss 
the alignment of the values suggested in our workshops with the outcomes 
of our quantitative analysis. Chapter 7 concludes the report with our key 
takeaways and potential directions for future work.
