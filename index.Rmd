# Introduction

This work aims to build upon existing research into the identification and classification of urban quality and sustainability in order to focus such efforts at the parcel scale and build a more systematic understanding of urban character at the scale at which incremental urban change and human interaction occurs within neighborhood fabric.  

Practical motivations for this work exist at the levels of both planning and design, growing from a concern over the state of housing in urban areas. The current housing crisis presents a clear and present need for more housing units in job-proximate areas, and for housing units that are a better match with changing family structures and contemporary household needs. While large-scale real estate development interests have ready access to high-quality market and demographic data, such interests tend to focus on the provision of large-scale multifamily developments on larger parcels of land, which provide a more efficient pathway to profit. As a result, millions of vacant infill lots in highly accessible urban areas that hold potential to provide a needed layer of 2-4 family workforce housing languish because their utilization requires a high degree of sensitivity to the local context in order to provide relevant and viable housing development.

In order to match the provision of more units with the provision of more relevant, sustainable, and contextually sensitive development, particularly in low-rise neighborhood fabric, better and more accessible data is required. The ambition of this research, which we consider a work in progress, is to bridge planning level concerns around the existing conditions and future location of housing with site level concerns over the design of future housing and unit types in relationship to the immediate context in terms of both physical character and demographic need.

The research also aims to visualize this site-level data in an accessible format with the intent of future action. This aspect of the work aims for practical relevance and applied action. In addition to the diagrams, charts, and images provided in this report, we are working to present the analysis described below in an accessible web-based format that allows key stakeholders to personalize and self-weight a place-based index of parcel level data to meet their own needs in relationship to understanding and incrementally changing urban fabric on a site-by-site basis.

The analysis is designed to serve a very specific band of public and private development-related stakeholders by exploring and daylighting an otherwise latent or invisible view onto urban fabric through the lens of value systems that are related to the mission or agenda of key stakeholders within the housing crisis. Stakeholders include local community advocates, civic leaders and policy makers, real estate developers, and designers who aim to better respond to the particularities of a place through site-level response to context. 

Each stakeholder type has a different value system, requiring a different view of the same data. For example, municipal governance needs a better understanding of the nature and impact of urban change in order to better calibrate zoning, housing policy, and related programming and respond to demographic factors and the character and/or type of existing housing stock. Such stakeholders will aim to protect affordability in historically marginalized communities and encourage equitable development with respect to access to desirable services and destinations (libraries, grocery stores, parks, etc.). 

Small-scale real estate developers, who do not have the analytic and legal resources of larger-scale developers, who are often members of the local community, and who provide the best opportunity for small-scale infill development at the “missing middle” scale, need a different weighting of the same data in order to seek housing development opportunities in viable areas. These stakeholders seek development opportunities that balance development feasibility in terms of construction cost and land value with market relevance in terms of unit type, job-accessibility, and location desirability for a given population. 

Residents and community stakeholders often lack the information and resources to advocate for local change with more than anecdote at public meetings, providing yet another set of values that require the visualization of the same data from a different perspective. For these stakeholders, data about the existing character of their places in terms of demographic and housing unit diversity, including a view onto the existing levels of community access to local resources in comparison to other places, is needed to make a case for future resources and housing types that will benefit the needs of their community.

To varying degrees, each stakeholder group currently lacks the tools and information to adequately understand local conditions on their own terms and in a way that is relevant to their particular roles in the provision, regulation, and advocacy of desperately needed housing. This information gap, which we aim to approach through this research, is a barrier to more and more relevant housing. 

In summary, we aim to utilize site level quantitative analysis to both build upon existing identification and classification efforts, and to provide a practical tool for a range of critical stakeholders within the housing crisis to understand, describe, and advocate for change in urban quality through the lens of their own value systems.

## Report organization

The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 discusses related 
work that we and others have done on the topic of evaluating urban quality 
and the challenges of highly-disaggregated spatial data. In Chapter 3, we 
describe a set of workshops we conducted with a diverse set of experts on 
urban development to identify values associated with urban quality. We go on
to propose a method for evaluating urban quality at the parcel level using 
readily available data for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in Chapter 4, and 
summarize the results of that analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we discuss 
the alignment of the values suggested in our workshops with the outcomes 
of our quantitative analysis. Chapter 7 concludes the report with our key 
takeaways and potential directions for future work.
